# Executive Warning Signals  
## Early indicators that market entry is failing structurally — not tactically

Market entry rarely fails because of missing knowledge or flawed strategy.  
It fails when organisations treat expansion as a project instead of an operating state.

The following warning signals indicate that a market entry is structurally at risk —  
often long before commercial results make this visible.

These signals are not operational issues.  
They are decision and ownership failures.

---

### 1. Market entry is framed as a “phase”
If market entry has a defined end date, launch milestone, or handover moment, commitment is temporary by design.  
Markets do not stabilise on timelines — organisations do.

---

### 2. Responsibility rotates after launch
When decision-makers change once the market is “live,” accountability weakens.  
Continuity matters more than speed in early execution.

---

### 3. Local decisions require constant headquarters validation
Escalation is not a support mechanism.  
It is a signal that ownership was never fully transferred.

---

### 4. Market execution is treated as a side responsibility
When leaders remain accountable for multiple markets or roles, local priorities compete — and lose.

---

### 5. Structures are provisional “until traction is proven”
Temporary structures signal hesitation.  
Customers and partners detect instability long before metrics confirm it.

---

### 6. Optimisation discussions precede real execution
When organisations debate scaling, tooling, or efficiency before stable execution exists, momentum stalls.

---

### 7. Commitment decreases once complexity increases
If leadership attention drops when friction appears, permanence was never intended.

---

### 8. Market signals are interpreted as “teething problems”
Repeated delays, slow decisions, or stalled pipelines framed as temporary noise usually indicate structural misalignment.

---

### 9. Authority exists on paper, not in practice
Formal mandates without practical decision power create coordination instead of execution.

---

### 10. Optionality is protected at the expense of clarity
When organisations avoid irreversible decisions, learning cycles slow and trust erodes.

---

## Closing note

Market entry does not fail because markets are difficult.  
It fails when permanence is treated as a risk — instead of the prerequisite for traction.

These warning signals rarely appear in isolation.  
When several are present, failure is often already underway — quietly.
