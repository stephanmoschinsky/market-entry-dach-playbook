# 90-Day Market Entry Execution Framework (DACH)

This framework translates market entry intent into executable reality.

Not strategy.
Not positioning.
Execution.

The goal of the first 90 days is not scale.
It is signal clarity.

---

## Phase 0: Mandate & Ownership (Pre-Day 1)

Before anything moves, these conditions must be true.

- Single accountable owner for market entry
- Written execution mandate from HQ
- Clear authority to make commercial decisions
- Defined success criteria for 90 days
- Explicit kill criteria if traction does not materialise

If this phase is skipped, execution will stall later.

---

## Phase 1: Structural Readiness (Days 1–30)

Objective: Enable execution without friction.

Focus areas:
- Legal and operational setup aligned to execution model
- Clear budget ownership
- Defined decision rights (what is decided locally vs centrally)
- One execution cadence (weekly, fixed agenda)
- Sales motion chosen and documented (not debated)

Outputs by Day 30:
- Operating model signed off
- Local execution owner empowered
- Go-to-market motion frozen
- No open structural questions

---

## Phase 2: Commercial Execution (Days 31–60)

Objective: Test reality, not assumptions.

Focus areas:
- Direct customer conversations
- Real sales cycles, not pilot theatre
- Pricing tested in live situations
- Objection patterns documented
- Internal response speed measured

What matters:
- Time-to-decision
- Deal friction points
- Internal alignment cost per deal

No optimisation yet.
Only signal collection.

---

## Phase 3: Scale Signal & Kill Criteria (Days 61–90)

Objective: Decide, not hope.

Key questions:
- Is there repeatable demand?
- Can deals close without escalation?
- Does the org support speed or slow it down?
- Is local ownership real or symbolic?

Decisions at Day 90:
- Double down
- Redesign execution model
- Pause or exit market

Indecision beyond Day 90 is failure by default.

---

## What This Framework Is Not

- Not a consulting roadmap
- Not a slide deck narrative
- Not a guarantee of success

It is an execution filter.
Weak setups fail fast.
Strong ones earn the right to scale.
