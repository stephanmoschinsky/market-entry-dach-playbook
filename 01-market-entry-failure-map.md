# Market Entry Failure Map (DACH)

Most market entry initiatives into Germany fail long before sales begin.

Not because of the market.
But because of internal breakdowns.

This map outlines the most common failure points.

---

## 1. Ownership & Mandate

- No clear accountable owner for market entry execution
- Split responsibility between HQ and local team
- Local leadership without real decision power
- “Exploration” without an execution mandate

---

## 2. Structure & Setup

- Legal entity created without operating model
- Country lead hired before scope is defined
- No clear budget ownership
- No success criteria beyond vague growth targets

---

## 3. Decision Architecture

- All decisions escalated to headquarters
- Local team waits for approvals
- No predefined decision rights
- Sales blocked by internal alignment loops

---

## 4. Market Interface

- No clear ICP for Germany / DACH
- Global messaging copied without localisation
- No credibility signals for risk-averse buyers
- Reference gap not addressed

---

## 5. Execution Reality

- Long sales cycles underestimated
- Sales targets disconnected from ramp-up reality
- Pipeline looks active, revenue does not move
- Momentum never compounds

---

This is a failure pattern — not an exception.

These are common patterns we consistently identify across DACH market entries. Our frameworks are designed to prevent these breakdowns by creating clear ownership and execution structures early on.
