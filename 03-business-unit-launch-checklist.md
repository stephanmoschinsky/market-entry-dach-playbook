# Business Unit Launch Checklist (DACH)

This checklist determines whether a market entry should launch — or be stopped.

If more than two items are unclear, do not launch.

---

## 1. Ownership & Mandate

- [ ] One single accountable owner named
- [ ] Written execution mandate from HQ
- [ ] Local leader has real decision authority
- [ ] Escalation path clearly defined and tested in real decision scenarios.
- [ ] Kill criteria explicitly agreed

If ownership is shared, execution will stall.

---

## 2. Operating Model

- [ ] Clear scope of responsibility with defined decision rights for the local unit.
- [ ] Budget ownership assigned locally
- [ ] Decision rights documented (what is local vs central)
- [ ] Weekly execution cadence fixed
- [ ] Reporting focused on execution, not optics

If decisions require constant HQ approval, speed is lost.

---

## 3. Commercial Readiness

- [ ] Defined target customer profile
- [ ] Clear value proposition in one sentence
- [ ] Pricing approved for live selling
- [ ] Sales motion chosen (direct, partner, hybrid)
- [ ] Objection handling documented

If sales cannot start immediately, the setup is not ready.

---

## 4. Internal Alignment

- [ ] HQ incentives aligned with local success
- [ ] No competing internal priorities blocking execution
- [ ] Support functions committed (Legal, Finance, HR)
- [ ] Response times agreed
- [ ] No parallel exploration or unaligned initiatives running. All focus must be on execution.

If alignment relies on goodwill, expect delays.

---

## 5. 90-Day Reality Check

- [ ] First real customer conversations completed
- [ ] Decision cycles clearly measured and aligned with real deal timelines.
- [ ] Internal friction points identified
- [ ] Demand signals validated or falsified
- [ ] Go / No-Go decision scheduled

No decision after 90 days equals failure by default.

## Rule of Use

This checklist is not a formality.

It is a gate.
If it fails, stop
