# Market Entry DACH – Execution Playbook

This repository outlines a practical execution framework for companies entering the German / DACH market.

Focus:
- ownership before strategy
- structure before scale
- execution before optimisation

This is not a consulting model.
It is an operator’s view on what actually breaks — and what works — in real market entry situations.
