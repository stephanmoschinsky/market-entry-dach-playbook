# Market Entry DACH – Execution Playbook

This repository is for founders, CEOs, and board-level operators 
responsible for international market entry into Germany / DACH.

If you are looking for general advice, best practices, or educational material,
this repository is not designed for you.

This repository documents recurring structural failure patterns in international DACH market entry — and the execution logic required to avoid them.

It is not a methodology.
It is not a checklist for delegation.
It is an executive reference for decision-making under uncertainty.

## How to use this repository

This repository is not meant to be consumed linearly.

If you are new to this repository:
Start with **04 – Executive Warning Signals**.
It will tell you whether deeper execution work is even necessary.

- Use **01** to recognise structural failure patterns.
- Use **02** to establish execution as an operating state.
- Use **03** to make irreversible launch and continuation decisions.
- Use **04** as an executive early warning system when friction appears.

If structural ownership is unclear at any point, execution will degrade — regardless of strategy.
